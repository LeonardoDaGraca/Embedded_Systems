## Overview:
- The goal of this project was to send analog signal to a DC motor to allow the motor to spin at different
  rates based on the sent signal. By using the Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)
  functions of the controller (Raspberry Pi), sending a signal from the controller to the motor
  to allow the motor to spin at varying rates was achieved. In addition, LEDs illuminate to inform the user of the status of the system.

## Task A:
- Build the proper circuit to operate the DC motor as described.

## Task B:
- Write correctly operating C code to perform all three options listed
  in the discussion section.
